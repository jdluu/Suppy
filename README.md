### Description
Suppy is the Discord Bot that I use for my own personal server

## Project Spec

I wrote this discord bot to allow for me to manage messages on my own server as well as clear out old content.

## Hosting

This discord bot is hosting on replit using their always on repls to keep the discord bot online. However, replit doesn't offer 24/7 hosting especially when there is no web traffic.

So, I combined my repl with uptime robot which pings the repl every 5 minutes keeping the bot alive indefinitely.
